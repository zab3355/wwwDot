              <h2>As we May Think</h2>
              <p>Vannevar Bush was born March 11 1890 in Chelsea Massachusetts and was sickly as a child. Despite passing away before the creation of the World Wide Web, Vannevar Bush wrote an article “As We May Think” in which he described his theoretical machine called “Memex.”</p>
              <p> Memex was used to improve human memory by allowing the user to store and retrieve documents linked by associations, which is where hypertext got it’s ideology from. Bush died on June 30th 1974, helping involuntarily with the development of the internet with the creation of the term “hypertext.” </p>

           <p>In Bush’s article, he makes a statement that surrounds and inspires others on the ideals of the World Wide Web by saying "The human mind does not work that way. It operates by association. With one item in its grasp, it snaps instantly to the next that it is suggested by the association of thoughts, in accordance with some intricate web of trails carried by the cells of the brain." Bush explains an example of how the brain stores information and how that structure could be used for applications in the future. While Bush accepted that an artificial duplication of this mental process was unrealistic, he said it'd be possible to emulate it in some way.</p>
