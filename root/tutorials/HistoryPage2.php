              <h2>ARPANet</h2>
              <p>In 1967, the Advanced Research Projects Agency of the United States government diverted $1 million from a missile defense system into a fund for researching networks, the product of which was dubbed ARPANet. Headed by Douglas Engelbart, ARPANet was one of the first systems designed for wireless interconnectivity and was headed out of two universities, UCLA and UC Berkeley.</p>

              <p>On October 29th, 1969 Charley Kline tried to send "login" from UCLA to UC Berkeley through ARPANet and, while they only got the letters "lo"
			  so it was very much incomplete, they successfully sent information wirelessly for the first time in human history. This led to a boom in research in this field</p>
			  <p>By two years after the first connection, there were 20 IMP's (the processors responsible for directing messages across the network) connected to ARPANet. A similar implementation was create called CSNet which was installed across the nation in universities which was focused toward sharing research projects amongst computer scientist. The US military also used ARPANet implementation to create Milinet which was for sharing military information instantaneously.</p>
