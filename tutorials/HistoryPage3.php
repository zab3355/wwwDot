              <p>HTML has had a life-span of roughly seven years. During that time, it has evolved from a simple language with a small number of tags to a complex system of mark-up, enabling authors to create all-singing-and-dancing Web pages complete with animated images, sound and all manner of gimmicks. This chapter tells you something about the Web's early days, HTML, and about the people, companies and organizations who contributed to HTML+, HTML 2, HTML 3.2 and finally, HTML 4.</p>

              <p>Tim Berners-Lee was born June 8, 1995 and invented the World Wide Web in 1989 and wrote the first web client server. Tim Berners-Lee made significant contributions for the basis on how the World Wide Web is run and lasts even today, from founding the Web Foundation and inventing URL's, HTTP, and HTML. Berners-Lee developed the web when he graduated from Oxford University while at CERN the European Particle Physics Laboratory in 1989.</p>
              <p> Berners-Lee is still alive today, researching and advancing the World Wide Web even more and still making ground breaking innovation discoveries that will benefit humanity.</p>
