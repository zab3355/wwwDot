    <h5> My name is Mo Choudhury. I’m a full-time student here at Rochester Institute of Technology majoring in Computing Information Technologies. I like working with computer networking and database systems. I was born deaf and raised in the Chicago area with my parents and sister; I’m the only deaf child in my family. I enjoy hanging out with people, working out, exploring new things, and working with PC.</h5>
