              <h2>Expansion of the Internet</h2>
              <p>About 5 years after ARPANet was found to be working and extremely effective at data transmission, France decided to research similar systems which led them to create CYCLADES and shared their research with the University College of London who developed CYCLADES further. in 1973, the University College of London and ARPANet made the first transatlantic connection, allowing Europe and America to exchange data freely.</p>
              <p>This led to thousands of nodes to pop up across Europe and connect to CYCLADES and ARPANet and quickly led to the expansion of the internet that we see today. This on top of the creation of email caused both the expansion of the internet and its usage by the general populous to increase exponentially.</p>
